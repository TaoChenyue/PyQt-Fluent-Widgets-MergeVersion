# PyQt-Fluent-Widgets[merge]

This is a multi branch merged code repository used to solve the problem of package name conflicts between different branches of the original repository in the same virtual environment.

## Modifications

1. Using ``git subtree``to obtain different branches and put them into same directory.
2. Import ``qtpy``to determine which QT_API to use
